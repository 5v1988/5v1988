## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Veera, and I have been in quality assurance and engineering for 14+ years and have extensive experience working for companies that are global leaders in banking, retail, utility, and software consulting businesses. As part of my work, I have used or relied on tools such as Selenium, Appium, Java, JavaScript, and Cucumber, to name a few, in order to improve the quality of software products I test.

Over the years, I have also had the privilege to offer testing solutions for companies such as Citi, British Gas, John Lewis Partnership, etc. directly on their premises in India, the UK, and the US.

Besides, I write technical blogs on qa testing, and offer consulting and testing solutions focusing on quality engineering and automation.

I can be reached at nmani0303@hotmail.com.

Thank You!
